- [Name 3]: [availability %]

Sprint Duration: [X] days
Historical Velocity: [Y] points average
Focus Factor: 70%

Calculate:
1. Total available person-days
2. Recommended story point commitment
3. Buffer for unexpected work
```

### Story Selection Helper
```
Help select stories for the sprint:

Available Stories:
[List of stories with points and priorities]

Constraints:

- Sprint goal: [goal]
- Must include: [required stories]
- Avoid: [constraints]

Select stories that:
1. Align with sprint goal
2. Fit within capacity
3. Balance new features and tech debt
4. Consider dependencies
```

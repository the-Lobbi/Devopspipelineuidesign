# Code Review

Perform a comprehensive code review of recent changes.

## Instructions

Execute a thorough code review using the following checklist:

### 1. Gather Changes

```bash
# View recent changes
git diff HEAD~1

# Or compare with main branch
git diff main...HEAD

# View changed files
git diff --name-only main...HEAD
```

### 2. Review Checklist

### 3. Static Analysis

```bash

python -m flake8 deployment/docker/ --max-line-length=100

# Security scan
pip install bandit
bandit -r deployment/docker/ -ll

# Helm validation
helm lint ./deployment/helm/golden-armada
```

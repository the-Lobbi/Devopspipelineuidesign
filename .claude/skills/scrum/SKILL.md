## Scrum Roles

### Product Owner
- Owns the Product Backlog
- Prioritizes items by business value
- Accepts/rejects completed work
- Represents stakeholders

### Scrum Master
- Facilitates Scrum events
- Removes impediments
- Coaches the team
- Protects the team from distractions

### Development Team
- Self-organizing (3-9 members)
- Cross-functional
- Delivers potentially shippable increments
- Commits to Sprint goals

## Sprint Ceremonies

### Sprint Planning (2-4 hours)
```markdown
## Sprint Planning Agenda

### Part 1: What (1-2 hours)
- Product Owner presents prioritized backlog items
- Team asks clarifying questions
- Team selects items for sprint based on capacity

### Part 2: How (1-2 hours)
- Team breaks stories into tasks
- Team estimates tasks (hours)
- Team creates Sprint Backlog

### Outputs:
- Sprint Goal
- Sprint Backlog
- Capacity commitment
```

### Daily Standup (15 minutes)
```markdown
## Daily Standup Format

Each team member answers:
1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. Are there any blockers?

### Rules:
- Same time, same place daily
- Standing up (keeps it short)
- Focus on sprint goal progress
- Detailed discussions after standup
```

### Sprint Review (1-2 hours)
```markdown
## Sprint Review Agenda

1. Sprint Goal Review (5 min)
   - Did we achieve the sprint goal?

2. Demo Completed Work (30-45 min)
   - Show working software
   - Stakeholder feedback

3. Product Backlog Update (15 min)
   - New items from feedback
   - Reprioritization

4. Release Discussion (15 min)
   - What can be released?
   - Timeline for deployment
```

### Sprint Retrospective (1-2 hours)
```markdown
## Retrospective Formats

### Start-Stop-Continue
- Start: What should we begin doing?
- Stop: What should we stop doing?
- Continue: What's working well?

### 4Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For)
- Liked: What went well?
- Learned: What did we learn?
- Lacked: What was missing?
- Longed For: What do we wish we had?

### Mad-Sad-Glad
- Mad: What frustrated us?
- Sad: What disappointed us?
- Glad: What made us happy?
```

## User Stories

### Story Format
```markdown
## User Story Template

**Title:** [Feature Name]

**As a** [type of user]
**I want** [goal/feature]
**So that** [benefit/value]

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]

### Definition of Done:
- [ ] Code complete
- [ ] Unit tests written (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] QA tested
- [ ] Product Owner accepted
```

### INVEST Criteria
- **I**ndependent: Can be developed separately
- **N**egotiable: Details can be discussed
- **V**aluable: Delivers value to user
- **E**stimable: Can be sized
- **S**mall: Fits in one sprint
- **T**estable: Has clear acceptance criteria

## Estimation

### Story Points (Fibonacci)
```
1  - Trivial (< 1 hour)
2  - Small (few hours)
3  - Medium (1 day)
5  - Large (2-3 days)
8  - Very Large (1 week)
13 - Epic (needs breakdown)
```

### Planning Poker
1. Product Owner presents story
2. Team discusses and asks questions
3. Each member privately selects estimate
4. All reveal simultaneously
5. Discuss outliers
6. Re-vote if needed
7. Consensus reached

## Velocity & Capacity

### Velocity Calculation
```python
# Average of last 3-5 sprints
velocities = [45, 42, 48, 40, 50]
average_velocity = sum(velocities) / len(velocities)  # 45 points

# Sprint capacity planning
team_members = 5
sprint_days = 10
availability = 0.8  # 80% (meetings, etc.)
capacity_hours = team_members * sprint_days * 6 * availability  # 240 hours
```
